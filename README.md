# Regression-Models

Introduction
The leading life insurance company wants to predict the bonus for its agents. This prediction is crucial in designing appropriate engagement activity for high-performing agents and upskilling programs for low-performing agents. By accurately estimating the bonus amounts, the company can allocate resources effectively and implement targeted strategies to enhance agent performance. These agents play a critical role in acquiring new clients, maintaining customer relationships, and driving sales. This, in turn, can lead to improved customer service, increased sales, and overall business growth.
The objective is to develop a machine learning model that considers historical agent performance data, customer satisfaction ratings, sales targets, training hours completed, and other relevant features to predict the bonus amount for each agent.
